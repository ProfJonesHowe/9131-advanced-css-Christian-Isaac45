<h1>A Day in the Life of Christian Isaac</h1>
<body>
<p> My name is Christian Isaac and I am one of thousands of students here at UAlbany. I am majoring in cybersecurity and quite frankly I am glad I chose to pursue
this over computer science. A day in the life of me, Christian Isaac, consists of getting up around 9am for my class that starts at 10:30. I typically lay in bed for another 5-10
minutes and then finally get out. I proceed to use the bathroom, brush my teeth, do my skincare, and change into what I want to wear to class. I always walk to class 
no matter if its at ETEC or the Massry building. Music is a must when going to class, I always have my headphones on blasting music from all different kinds of genres.
After class I typically grab lunch with friends at the nearest dining hall or head to the campus center to get something. Stay tuned for Part two.
